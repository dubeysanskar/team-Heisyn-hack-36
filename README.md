## 🧩 Introduction

**Codify** is a unified and secure platform designed to bridge the gap between **students** preparing for interviews and **recruiters** searching for qualified talent.  
It delivers a two-sided ecosystem:

- 🎓 **For Students:** Personalized roadmaps, AI-powered resume builder, RAG chatbot for interview prep, coding practice, mock interviews, and a skill-barter community.
- 🧑‍💼 **For HR/Recruiters:** Automated candidate shortlisting, AI-driven interview pipelines, detailed candidate reports, and seamless integrations with ATS/job boards.

Codify embodies the **Hack36 9.0 Secure** theme with security-by-design principles — encryption, consent management, MFA, and secure orchestration through n8n.
